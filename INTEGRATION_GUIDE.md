# GrantScope Newbie-Friendly Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This guide shows how to integrate all the newbie-friendly features into the existing GrantScope app using Streamlit's capabilities.

## âœ… What We Can Do in Streamlit

### 1. **Onboarding Wizard** â†’ Add to `app.py`
```python
# Add to main() function in app.py
def main():
    # Add onboarding check
    if 'user_experience' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.user_experience = "New to grants"
    
    # Show onboarding for new users
    if st.session_state.user_experience == "New to grants" and 'onboarding_complete' not in st.session_state:
        from onboarding_wizard import onboarding_wizard
        onboarding_wizard()
        return  # Don't show main app until onboarding complete
```

### 2. **Enhanced User Roles** â†’ Modify `utils/app_state.py`
```python
# Replace existing user roles with experience-based ones
def get_user_roles():
    return {
        "I'm new to grants": {
            "pages": ["Data Summary", "Grant Amount Distribution", "Success Stories"],
            "features": ["basic_charts", "plain_english", "recommendations"]
        },
        "I have some experience": {
            "pages": ["Data Summary", "Grant Amount Distribution", "Grant Amount Heatmap", "Word Clouds"],
            "features": ["basic_charts", "intermediate_analysis"]
        },
        "I'm a grant professional": {
            "pages": "all",  # All pages available
            "features": "all"  # All features available
        }
    }
```

### 3. **Plain-English Chart Explanations** â†’ Enhance `plots/data_summary.py`
```python
def add_chart_explanation(chart_type: str, data: pd.DataFrame):
    """Add plain-English explanations to any chart"""
    
    explanations = {
        "top_funders": f"""
        **What this chart tells you:**
        - These organizations have the most money to give away
        - {data.iloc[0]['funder_name']} gave out ${data.iloc[0]['amount_usd']:,.0f} - that's the most!
        - Don't just chase the biggest - sometimes smaller funders are easier to get
        
        **Your next step:** Pick 2-3 from this list and research their websites
        """,
        "funder_types": f"""
        **What this pie chart means:**
        - Each slice shows a different type of organization that gives money
        - Bigger slices = more money available from that type
        - "Foundation" = private organizations with money to give away
        - "Government" = federal, state, or local agencies with funding programs
        """
    }
    
    if chart_type in explanations:
        st.info(explanations[chart_type])
```

### 4. **Smart Recommendations** â†’ Add to `utils/recommendations.py`
```python
class GrantRecommender:
    """AI-powered recommendations for grant seekers"""
    
    def __init__(self, user_profile: dict, grant_data: pd.DataFrame):
        self.user_profile = user_profile
        self.grant_data = grant_data
    
    def get_personalized_recommendations(self):
        """Generate personalized funding recommendations"""
        
        recommendations = []
        
        # Budget recommendation
        median_grant = self.grant_data['amount_usd'].median()
        if self.user_profile.get('budget_range') == "Under $5,000" and median_grant > 10000:
            recommendations.append({
                "type": "budget",
                "title": "Consider asking for more money",
                "explanation": f"Most grants in your area are around ${median_grant:,.0f}. You might be aiming too low!",
                "action": "Research grants in the $10K-$25K range"
            })
        
        # Geographic recommendations
        local_funders = self.grant_data[
            self.grant_data['grant_geo_area_tran'].str.contains('Local', na=False)
        ]
        if len(local_funders) > 0:
            recommendations.append({
                "type": "geographic", 
                "title": "Local opportunities available",
                "explanation": f"Found {len(local_funders)} local funders - these are often easier to get!",
                "action": "Prioritize local foundations and community organizations"
            })
        
        return recommendations
    
    def display_recommendations(self):
        """Display recommendations in Streamlit"""
        recommendations = self.get_personalized_recommendations()
        
        if recommendations:
            st.subheader("ðŸŽ¯ Personalized Recommendations")
            for rec in recommendations:
                with st.expander(f"ðŸ’¡ {rec['title']}"):
                    st.write(rec['explanation'])
                    st.success(f"Next step: {rec['action']}")
        else:
            st.info("Keep exploring! As you use GrantScope more, we'll get better at recommending opportunities.")
```

### 5. **Interactive Project Planner** â†’ New page `pages/Project_Planner.py`
```python
import streamlit as st
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def project_planner_page():
    """Interactive project planning for grant newcomers"""
    
    st.title("ðŸŽ¯ Grant Project Planner")
    st.write("Let's turn your idea into a fundable project!")
    
    # Step-by-step wizard
    with st.form("project_planner"):
        
        # Project definition
        st.subheader("Step 1: What's the problem you're solving?")
        problem = st.text_area(
            "In simple terms, what issue are you trying to fix?",
            placeholder="Example: Kids in my neighborhood don't have safe places to play after school"
        )
        
        # Target audience  
        st.subheader("Step 2: Who will benefit from your project?")
        beneficiaries = st.multiselect(
            "Select all that apply:",
            ["Children", "Seniors", "Families", "Environment", "Small businesses"]
        )
        
        # Activities
        st.subheader("Step 3: What will you actually do?")
        activities = st.text_area(
            "List 3-5 specific things you'll do:",
            placeholder="1. Build a playground\n2. Hire after-school staff\n3. Buy sports equipment"
        )
        
        # Budget range
        st.subheader("Step 4: What's your budget range?")
        budget = st.select_slider(
            "Expected budget:",
            options=["Under $5K", "$5K-$25K", "$25K-$100K", "$100K-$500K", "Over $500K"]
        )
        
        # Timeline
        st.subheader("Step 5: When do you need funding?")
        timeline = st.selectbox(
            "Timeline:",
            ["ASAP (within 3 months)", "This year", "Next year", "Flexible"]
        )
        
        submitted = st.form_submit_button("Create My Project Plan ðŸš€")
        
        if submitted:
            # Generate project summary
            st.success("ðŸŽ‰ Your project is ready!")
            
            project_summary = f"""
            ## Project Summary
            
            **Problem:** {problem}

            **Timeline:** {timeline}
            
            ## Next Steps
            1. Use GrantScope to find funders who support projects like yours
            2. Download this summary and start researching foundations  
            3. Contact 3-5 funders to introduce yourself
            """
            
            st.markdown(project_summary)
            
            # Download button
            st.download_button(

                mime="text/markdown"
            )
```

### 6. **Enhanced AI Chat** â†’ Modify `utils/chat_panel.py`
```python
def newbie_friendly_chat(prompt: str, context: dict):
    """Make AI chat responses more friendly for grant newcomers"""
    
    newbie_prompts = {
        "what does this chart mean": """
        Explain this chart like I'm 5 years old. Use simple words and give me 
        actionable advice about what I should do next with this information.

        "how do I get started": """
        I'm completely new to grants. Give me a simple 3-step plan to get started.
        Don't use technical jargon. Tell me exactly what to do this week.
        """,
        "what should I ask for": """
        Based on the data, what amount should I ask for? Give me a specific number 
        and explain why in plain English.
        """
    }
    
    # Check if user is asking a newbie question
    for key, newbie_prompt in newbie_prompts.items():
        if key in prompt.lower():
            return f"{newbie_prompt}\n\nContext: {context}"
    
    return prompt
```

### 7. **Success Stories** â†’ New component `components/success_stories.py`
```python
import streamlit as st

def success_stories():
    """Inspirational success stories for grant newcomers"""
    
    stories = [
        {
            "title": "Library Gets $50K for After-School Program",
            "person": "Sarah, Librarian", 
            "story": "I thought grants were only for big organizations. GrantScope helped me find 5 local foundations that fund education programs. I got $50,000 to create an after-school reading program!",
            "budget": "$50,000",
            "timeline": "6 months",
            "key_to_success": "Started small - applied for $5,000 first, then used that success to get larger grants"
        },
        {
            "title": "Community Garden Gets $25K Funding",
            "person": "Mike, Volunteer Coordinator",
            "story": "We wanted to build a community garden but had no money. The timeline advisor showed us we needed 6 months, not 2. We followed the plan and got $25,000 from 3 different funders!",
            "budget": "$25,000", 
            "timeline": "8 months",
            "key_to_success": "Applied to multiple funders with the same project - increased our odds"
        }
    ]
    
    st.subheader("ðŸŒŸ Success Stories from People Like You")
    
    for story in stories:
        with st.expander(f"ðŸ“– {story['title']}"):
            col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
            
            with col1:
                st.markdown(f"**{story['person']}**")
                st.write(f"ðŸ’° Budget: {story['budget']}")
                st.write(f"ðŸ“… Timeline: {story['timeline']}")
            
            with col2:
                st.write(story['story'])
