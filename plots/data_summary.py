        Welcome to the GrantScope Tool! This powerful prototype application was built by [Christopher Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cctopher/) to assist grant writers and analysts in navigating and extracting insights from a complex grant dataset. By leveraging the capabilities AI integrated with this tool, you can identify potential funding opportunities, analyze trends, and gain valuable information.

        The application has select pages which have been enhanced with experimental features from Llama-Index's QueryPipeline for Pandas Dataframes, and OpenAI GPT-5 to provide you with additional insights and analysis. You can interact with the AI assistant to ask questions, generate summaries, and explore the data in a more intuitive manner.

        The preloaded dataset encompasses a small sample of grant data, including details about funders, recipients, grant amounts, subject areas, populations served, and more. With this tool, you can explore the data through interactive visualizations, filter and search for specific grants, and download relevant data for further analysis.
